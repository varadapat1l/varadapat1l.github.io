**Introduction to Programming I**  
_Net Force Calculator Program_  
* Created an interactive application using Python that is designed to compute forces in a two-dimensional plane
* Devloped a 'ForceCalculator' class to manage force objects
* Included an intuitive text-based menu to guide users through available options, as well as stop and start over when necessary
* Ideal for students, professionals and/or physics enthusiasts who need to perform vector addition of forces, determine force components, and calculate resultant forces
