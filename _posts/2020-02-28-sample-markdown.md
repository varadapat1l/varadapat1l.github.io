I am a junior at Michigan State University, majoring in Computer Science under the College of Engineering, with a minor in Indian and South Asian Languages. 

While I did not begin my career at MSU as a Computer Science major, after taking an introductory programming course, I was immediately captivated by the blend of creativity, logic, and problem-solving found in coding. Whether it's creating a new application, exploring the intricacies of algorithms, or revamping pre-existing code, I love bringing new ideas to life through code.

As I further delve into the world of programming, I am excited to hone my skills and aid in shaping the future through technology!
